[React-App-ToDo](https://wladislaw28.github.io/react-test-todo/) - Using the ToDo application, the user can create records (tasks) consisting of four input fields (input text; input date; select; textarea). Implemented functionality for adding, deleting, and marking a task as completed.
Redux was used in the application.
